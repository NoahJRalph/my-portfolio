# 02 My Portfolio

## Description

The following site was made and deployed following the instruction of my bootcamp module-2 challenge. The primary focus of the challenge was to create a full portfilio website from scratch that properly advertises my skills to potential employers, and then allow the code to flourish on a deployed site platform.

## Deployment

[Here.](https://NoahJRalph.github.io/my-portfolio)

## Notable Features

1. Site contains all relevant information without need for scrolling. This was not required.
2. Cool webpage tab title. Was not required.
3. All site links work properly and as intended.
4. Links to my works are listed properly and will be expanded on in the future.
5. All images have proper alt descriptions in HTML.
6. Cool background video. Was not required.
7. Impressively few lines to my CSS and HTML. Was not required, I just wanted it that way.
8. Webpage contents all scale properly with just about any screen size including all the way down to 100x100 and potentially below. Required, but not to the extent that I implemented. Definitely went above and beyond for this feature.
10. Full ReadMe has been iterated. It me, I'm the ReadMe. Hello. I hope you enjoyed reading my contents.
